<AsideElt title="History">The Capital PC User Group, Inc. (CPCUG) was founded in 1982 and is one of the nation's oldest and largest computer groups. In 1997 several CPCUG volunteers got together and founded Project Reboot to recycle computers for students in Montgomery County Maryland. We have branched out some since those early days to include not just students and schools but also non-profits.</AsideElt>
<AsideElt title="Volunteers">Project Reboot is 100% run by volunteers, we have no paid staff.</AsideElt>
