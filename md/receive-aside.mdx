    When you arrive at Project Reboot, the people at the front desk will ask you
    to sign in. Next the front desk personnel will ask for your identification
    and why you are at Project Reboot (new computer or repair). New computer
    requests are handled right at the Front Desk. Repairs require that you speak
    with the Technical Officer and describe the problem that you're having.
  </Block>
  <Block>
    You will be allowed to pick out your own computer and accessories from the
    rack of available equipment at the Front Desk.
  </Block>
  <Block>
    If you are traveling by bus, make sure that you have some sort of a cart for
    carrying the computer home. An airport style luggage carrier is usually
    enough.
  </Block>
  <Block>
    Purchasing a refurbished computer takes, on average, about 30 minutes.

    <strong>Laptops: </strong>Unfortunately, the demand for laptops far
    outweighs the supply. Our capacity to provide laptops is limited and laptops
    are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. If you are unsure of the
    process please ask us via email or phone.
