## POLICY â€” LAPTOP and DESKTOP COMPUTERS AND REPAIRS

### Repairs within 90 days from computer pickup

ALL SALES ARE FINAL. If your computer stops working, you can bring it back to Project Reboot for free repairs within 90 days. If we can fix it quickly, we will. If we cannot repair it, we will replace it free of charge. If the problem is due to your acts or negligence (see below), we will do neither free of charge. The decision is solely that of our Chief Technical Officer. Batteries are NOT covered by our warrantee.

### Infected Computers

A computer infected with a virus, Trojan, work or other rogue software can usually be repaired. However, disinfecting your computer is not done for free. We charge \$10 to disinfect a Windows 7.
We install Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), an excellent antivirus and antispyware application, on every computer. MSE updates itself and runs quietly in the background to keep your computer safe. If you want to, you may replace MSE with another application that provides real-time antivirus and anti-spyware protection. If you uninstall your antivirus software or disable its real-time protection, you void the software warranty from Project Reboot as described above. Beware that when you download software, music, videos, etc. from untrusted vendors or from file sharing services (torrents), trojans and spyware often come along for the ride.

### Operating system

All of our computers run Microsoft Windows 7. Microsoft issues enhancements and fixes to Windows at least once a month. When you received your computer, it was set to download and install high-priority updates automatically. If you turn off Automatic Updates, be sure to update manually on or about the 15th of every month. If you install or re-install any operating system, we will proceed in the same way as for infected computers (see above).

### Your data

Your computer uses a hard disk drive for permanent storage. The drive rotates faster than a car engine. Like a car, it will fail sooner or later, and your data will be lost. You must frequently back up your data onto CDs or flash drives. If you don't know how, ask a friend to show you. If we replace your computer, you will lose all your applications and data. Ask the Technical Officer is we can provide the data recovery service; we do not guarantee that your data can be recovered (some disks are recoverable, some are not).

### Passwords

Project Reboot has no way to retrieve your passwords. If your computer is password-protected, whoever brings it in must know the password for at least one account with Administrator privileges, and the password (if any) for the BIOS Setup Utility. The Chief Technical Officer will assess a \$10 fee to remove each password.

### Other computers

We do not operate a repair service for computers not issued by Project Reboot. You may donate your non-working computer, but you cannot substitute it for a replacement. You can, however, receive a computer from Project Reboot with an approved referral letter and the \$25 Fee (Win 7).

### Save a trip to Reboot

Before bringing a computer in for repair, try substituting known good monitors, keyboards, etc., to see what is broken. For Internet trouble, call your Internet provider's tech support before bringing the computer to us.

### What to expect at Project Reboot

Expect to wait an hour or more to see the repair technician. It will take anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours to examine and repair your computer, or to decide to replace it. You can leave your computer for repairs if the wait is too long. Because you are registered with us, you will not need another Referral Letter for repairs.
