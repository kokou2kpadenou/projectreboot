## Receiving a Computer from Project Reboot

<Float>Project Reboot provides low cost computers to students whose families are on public assistance for low income or disability.</Float>

### If this is your first visit to Project Reboot, you need three things to receive a low cost computer from Project Reboot

#### 1. Referral form (signed) from 1 of more than 800 area referring agents registered with Project Reboot.

Project Reboot works with more than 1100 referring agents in the metropolitan DC area. Typical referring agents are school counselors and principles, Linkages to Learning staff, government case workers, etc. If you have a question as to which schools and agencies are already registered with us, give us a call.

#### 2. Picture ID that matches the name on the referral form

We check to make certain that the name on the referral form matches with the person picking up the computer. We do make a couple of exceptions though. First, if a parent is picking up for a child and the parent's ID has the same last name and address as the name on the referral form we consider that a close enough match. Second, if picking up a computer for someone else we require that you have at least a photo-copy of the picture ID of the person for whom the referral was made.

#### 3. Enough cash to purchase your computer.

We try to keep the cost of these computers as low as we can but we do have to charge some amount. We do not accept checks or credit cards - cash only.

When you first came to Project Reboot, we entered your name into our Client database. On your return for another computer, we check to make certain that the name in our database matches with the person picking up the computer. We do make a couple of exceptions though. First, if a parent is picking up for a child and the parent's ID has the same last name and address as the name in the database we consider that a close enough match. Second, if picking up a computer for someone else we require that you have at least a photo-copy of the picture ID of the person listed in the database.

#### 2. Enough cash to purchase your computer.
